            <h1>Blah-blah-blog!</h1>
            
            <p>I am a “Jill of All Trades.” I love learning, and I have taken 200+ college and university units. Initially, I did this to find what subjects and skills that I do and do not prefer. But eventually, it became an outlet, to balance my life. My working life may not always fulfill my intellectual and creative needs, so school can always compensate, like a hobby.</p>

            <p>In addition to being a student, I have a few other hobbies and interests. Firstly, I love nature, including all types of animals and even insects. I like the sanctitude and the reminder that life is more than a fast-paced and human orchestrated world. I love to watch documentaries and science specials about all things on our planet and beyond. Topics have included the history of jazz, beatniks and hippies, secret lives of cats, the cosmos, and the science of attraction/dating.</p>
            
            <p>Another past-time is exploring human relationships. I am intrigued by humans do what they do; how they think and feel and interact with others. I have several books on psychology, spirituality, and astrology to all aid in the process of understanding humans.</p>
            
            <p>In terms of more physical hobbies, I love to sing and to dance (all styles). I am really enjoying yoga too, although the technical names of positions are really hard for me to remember. One of the more recent generic position names that I had learned was Cow Face. That name makes me smile. I also jog and walk on sunny days. I play a little piano, but those are hard to find, so I am learning acoustic guitar.</p>
